# Riccardo Caraccio
I am a PhD student working at the [CRECK modeling group](https://www.creckmodeling.polimi.it/), [Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/).
My research activity mainly focuses on the multiscale modeling of biomass pyrolysis and combustion.
In this sandbox you will find my code related to the simulation of flow in porous media and the simulation of biomass particle.

## Simulations
A brief description of the main simulations reported in this sandbox.

### Porous media
Various simulations testing the implementation of the [Darcy-Forchheimer penalization term](src/darcy.h) that allows accounting for the presence of a porous medium in the one-field Navier-Stokes equations.

* [Wake behind a porous cylinder](run/porous-cylinder.c)
* [Flow obstructed by a porous plug](run/porous-plug.c)
* [Flow in a partially porous channel](run/porous-channel.c)

### Biomass pyrolysis
Coming soon!

### Biomass combustion
Coming soon!
